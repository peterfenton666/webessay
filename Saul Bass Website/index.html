                                Saul Bass is one of the most accomplished designers in graphic design and motion graphics. His work varied across many different industries with having created iconic logos and movie posters. His minimalist design style has stood the test of time with organisations such as the girl scouts largely unchanged, still using the same silhouette with slightly varying changes.

                                Saul Bass moved to New York in 1920. At this point in his life he was doing freelance illustration work for local shop fronts. This earned Saul a scholarship to the Art Students League where he studied “layout and design for industry”. The term Graphic Design hadn't been coined yet but it focused on the same practises. 
His use of simple shapes and as well as form and function within his works was heavily influenced by his teacher Gyorgy Kepes. Kepes attended the Bauhaus school in Germany where their design principles mainly focused on form and function. Using minimalism to convey different messages, feelings and emotions within the design work. This spurred Saul Bass to use these principles in each of his works, in his own words on the topic of his opening title sequences “My initial thought about what a title can do was to set mood, and the prime underlying core of the film’s story, to express the story in some metaphorical way. I saw the title as a way of conditioning the audience, so that when the film actually began, viewers would already have an emotional resonance with it”.

The first poster which marked Saul Bass’ name within the industry was the poster for Otto Preminger’s Carmen Jones. The poster presents a still black and white image of the leading actress Dorthy Dandrige. The only other colour included is the red which is seen on her dress and her lips. This simple detail represents the fiery seductive nature of the film’s leading character. This as previously mentioned was abnormal to have such a minimalist approach as films of the day would plaster character faces as well as descriptions onto posters as this was the method of marketing at the time. This is taken for granted today as alot of films market their movies this way. Take this sielnce of the lambs poster, it uses minimal colour. The only colour appearing in clarice's eyes and the moth. The moth is a deathmoth which buffalo bill obseeses over in the film. This shows how colour can express elements of a film. In Saul Bass' time this was a game-changer. This method of design to encapsulate the tone of film was used again and again throughout Saul Bass’ career and can be seen most notably in his famous title sequences. This has influenced many aspects of design and marketing not only in film, but in all forms of product design and advertising as evoking emotional responses within the audience sells, so Saul Bass’ influence cannot be underestimated. 
In this essay we will cover the significance of Saul Bass’ career within graphic design in film, and in logo design. These both have influenced the current way we design today so discussing these two aspects of Saul Bass’ career will be of most use.

                                    He began his commercial career after leaving Art Students League as a label designer and a designer for a photo-offset plant. He then went on to design trade ads for United Artists. Since joining the United Artists, Saul was already becoming a prominent designer within film marketing. He pushed the boundaries visually by creating designs which reflected the story of the film in terms of mood and atmosphere. Initially he solely used graphic design but then began to include photography to portray the characters of the film. This was important within film marketing as up until this point film’s were marketed the same as newspapers and other forms of media where which simply was to say “Go see this film”, with a clutter of other information crammed into one poster. Saul reduced what was needed on the poster which made each element more important and detailed in meaning. Including the emotions of what a movie wanted to convey, condensed onto a canvas was unprecedented.

                    Between 1970 and 1987 Saul Bass took a break from the world of cinema due to a decrease in the use of opening sequences within film. During this time he decided to focus more on true graphic design by creating many famous logos for corporations that are still relevant today. According to William Haig a graphic designer who worked with Saul Bass, the two were discussing one night what way you would redesign for continental airlines. Bass said that if it were western airlines that he would create a ‘western’ looking logo.

                    The point he tries to make here is that people will recognise logos instantly when there is an association with the name. For example his continental airlines logo design uses simple lines to emulate a jetstream. These simple lines can represent so much when they are designed well as. That is key with logo design today as logos are the main form of advertising and promotion. The M in the Mcdoanlds logo can be recognised by anyone today and the company can be identified by anyone even though its just an M made to look like two fries joining. Even if its sub-consicous the consumer still recognise this as a fast-food chain just by looking at the logo. Simple design which can represent so much was the key to Saul Bass; success.

            Before Saul Bass, films used static typography for their films. The static text, with names of people involved in the film, was just projected onto the curtains before the film started. These title sequences were done in a different film reel and were flashed directly on the curtains of the theatre and this part of going to the movies was called pop corn time, meaning that no one was really paying attention going intmovingo the experience.  Saul Bass introduced the idea of kinetic typography which is text during title sequences. His breakout moment came with the film the golden arm which in which he designed the opening title sequence. He initially was working on the films ad campaigns, designing 
            symbols for the film's poster when director Otto Preminger asked him to design the opening title sequence as well. This is why the arm features in both the poster and the title sequence which helped keep the films promtion and showcase consistent and recognisable.

                Bass’ works in Alfred Hitchcock’s films like Pyscho (1960) that will make him known in the film industry and his career spanned over until the 1990;s with him doing the title sequence for movies like Goodfellas (1990) and Casino (1995)
                He wanted the title sequence to become a prelude to the film’s story, something that will make it more engaging and help spark some curiosity to the movie-goers.
                His art and typography was often intentionally identifiable as hand-drawn to further carry over the meaning he wanted to convey to an audience.

            Saul Bass has influenced future generations of designers such as Kyle Cooper who has created the opening title 
            sequences to Se7en, Mimic and Spider-man. Cooper follows Saul Bass' vision of what opening title sequences brings to a movie with him saying.
            "It sets up and expectation for the film. The key is to use type and simple shapes to covey metaphors and set the appropriate tone." This is clear from all three examples. With the Spider-man title sequence Cooper uses web geometry throughout with different depictions of scenes from the previous film. This is so the viewer enters the film with all the previous events being recalled, jogging the memory of the viewer, making it then easier to follow along. In seven the graphic design elements are a lot more simpler with rough hand writing and cut out type alongside jumpy animations. Cooper wants to spark a creepy, eerie, nervous mood within the viewer as the film is about a psychopath who relates his killings to the seven deadly sins. Cooper reinvigorated title sequences in the 1990’s just as Saul Bass reinvented title sequences in the 1950’s.
